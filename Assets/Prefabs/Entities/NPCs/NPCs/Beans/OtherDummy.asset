    runnning around.
  - I mean, I'm not worried about him, he's a General and all... but it's ought to
    be a stressful and unpleasant journey.
  - We need to be good hosts to him, make a good impression, if we want <place>Blaumond</place>'s
    help.
  - ...
  - Don't go harassing him to take you to <place>The Moon</place>. Okay?
