  dialogueLines:
  - You can specialise in either one if you want, you can also balance them, both
    options are good.
  - <mechanic>Recovery</mechanic>'s for those who prefer to be reliable and stable.
    Better safe than sorry.
  - <mechanic>Creativity</mechanic>'s for those who welcome a bit more chaos in their
    lives, for "better" or for "sorry".
  - The choice's always up to you, and you can always exchange your <mechanic>recovery</mechanic>
    for <mechanic>creativity</mechanic> and vice-versa in <place>towns</place>.
  - Well, only with more development time...
