  dialogueLines:
  - You <mechanic>hold shift</mechanic>. Once you've got enough <mechanic>mana</mechanic>,
    you <mechanic>attack</mechanic>.
  - <mechanic>Don't let go of shift</mechanic> before attacking, you'll just lose
    your <mechanic>mana</mechanic> for nothing.
  - Oh, and if you <mechanic>focus mana</mechanic> but don't use it, <mechanic>you
    don't get it back</mechanic>! So be careful of that.
  - <mechanic>Mana</mechanic> is powerful, but it shouldn't be used willy-nilly.
    Keep it for when it really matters, it could save your life!
