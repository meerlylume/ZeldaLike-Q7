  dialogueLines:
  - You're better off healing at <place>Breather Zones</place>, you heal about <mechanic>twice
    as more</mechanic> in there!
  - Or, maybe you could find some <item>Gauge Boost Crystals</item> and use them
    to get more <mechanic>mana</mechanic> to spare.
  - Or look for some <item>Spiritual Boost Crystals</item> to raise your <mechanic>Creativity</mechanic>
    or <mechanic>Recovery</mechanic>?
  - The more recovery you have, the more you heal from <mechanic>auto-regeneration</mechanic>
    and <item>items</item>.
  - The more <mechanic>creativity</mechanic> you have, the stronger the damage boost
    from mana focusing gets!
  - You also get <mechanic>critical hits</mechanic> more often, so that can help
    in fights too!
  - Oh, and more <mechanic>recovery</mechanic> also means you don't have to deal
    with negative status effects for as long.
  - Theoretically. Status effects are for a later version.
  - <mechanic>Creativity</mechanic> would give you more chance at inflicting negative
    status effects on your foes, theoretically.
  - And <mechanic>recovery</mechanic> makes you faster while you're charging mana.
  - It's a tough choice to make, isn't it?
