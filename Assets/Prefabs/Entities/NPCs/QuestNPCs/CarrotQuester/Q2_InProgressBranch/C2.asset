  - Believe it or not, but Mana can do other things than light lanterns or be pretty.
  - We had it in excess when we were living on <place>The Moon</place>, but we didn't
    have much to use it on.
  - <name>The Managarm</name> wanted it for a reason...
  - 'There''s plenty of spells it can be used for: attacking, healing, boosting,
    and so on.'
  - I myself only know how to fight with it, but again, I'm too cowardly to fight
    anyway.
  - I'd love to see if you'll get a better use of it.
