  - Believe it or not, but <mechanic>mana</mechanic> can do other things than light
    lanterns or look pretty.
  - We had it in excess when we were living on <place>The Moon</place>, but we didn't
    have much to use it on.
  - <name>The Managarm</name> wanted it for a reason...
  - 'There''s plenty of <mechanic>spells</mechanic> it can be used for: attacking,
    healing, boosting, and so on.'
  - I myself only know how to fight with it, but again, I'm too cowardly to fight
