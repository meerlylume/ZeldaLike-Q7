  description: It's an apple. I don't know what you were expecting. Most basic fruit
    ever /neg. It's not even that good. What's that? What have apples ever done to
    me? They burnt my village to the ground and stranded my wife. I have every right
    to be bitter. Fuck you if you like apples. They're problematic.
